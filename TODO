	* Make the route able to accept uploaded files and configure where they should be saved.

	* The first server for a host:port will be the default for this host:port (that means
	it will answer to all the requests that don’t belong to an other server).


	//TODO CGI avanzado

	//DE EVAL....cgi no es excepcion...
		* Writing or reading ANY file descriptor without going through the select() (or equivalent) is strictly FORBIDDEN.

	* A request to your server should never hang forever. (CGI)

	∗Because you won’t call the CGI directly, use the full path as PATH_INFO.

	∗Just remember that, for chunked request, your server needs to unchunk
	it, the CGI will expect EOF as end of the body.

	∗Same things for the output of the CGI. If no content_length is returned
	from the CGI, EOF will mark the end of the returned data.

	∗Your program should call the CGI with the file requested as first argument.

	∗The CGI should be run in the correct directory for relative path file access.

	∗Your server should work with one CGI (php-CGI, Python, and so forth).

	//TODO rutas cgi??

	route /cgi-bin {
		methods GET POST
		default  multiply.cgi
